## Chronological Work Log

### [2026-09-28] — Phase 3 Implementation & Audit Reconciliation: Canonical Benchmarking & Reward Alignment
- **Status**: \AUDITED & RECONCILED (Awaiting Reward Revision Approval)- **Contributors**: Full Team (Member 1, Member 2, Member 3, Member 4, Pair AI Assistant)
- **Reconciled Audit Findings & Canonical Benchmark (30 Seeds: 50000..50029)**:
  - **1. Discrepancy Resolution on Pareto rho=0.8 Mean WT**:
    - 78.3 us: Single-episode evaluation on seed 50000 only.
    - 328.7 us: 30-seed mean on standard bounded Pareto jobs.
    - 433.6 +/- 151.1 us: Canonical 30-seed mean for observation-space Heuristic.
    - 645.8 +/- 213.2 us: Canonical 30-seed mean for Teacher-50k.
    - 1,085.9 us: Extended 500k-step run evaluated on an unbounded Pareto distribution with heavy-tailed outlier seed 50007 (task burst = 96 ms).
  - **2. Canonical Performance Summary**:
    - Under identical eval conditions (N=30 seeds, q=5 ms, 10% estimator noise std), observation-space Heuristic beats PPO Teacher on every workload (Pareto 0.8: 433.6 us vs 645.8 us; Convoy: 2,477.5 us vs 7,424.5 us).
    - MLFQ priority demotion was validated: properly demotes quantum-exceeded jobs and achieves 1,343.2 +/- 576.3 us at Pareto 0.8 (beating RR-5ms at 1,728.8 +/- 1,191.0 us).
  - **3. Reward Breakdown & Weight Discrepancy**:
    - Actual training weight from configs/ppo_production.yaml: w_switch = 0.05. In standalone python scripts without config loading, default class value was 0.20.
    - Per-term reward analysis proves reward misalignment: Teacher accumulates +88.21 total reward vs. +85.21 for Heuristic because Heuristic incurs 15 additional switches (w_switch penalty) to preempt long jobs in favor of newly arrived short jobs.
  - **4. Convoy Workload Trace**:
    - At arrival step, Task 1 (50ms head) has score -0.0277, while Task 2 (100us arrival) has score -0.0323. Task 1 scores higher by +0.0046, preventing preemption and forcing Task 1 to run for its full 5ms quantum.
  - **5. Supervised Student Evaluation inside SchedulerEnv**:
    - The 16->8->1 Student network was fitted via supervised regression to the heuristic rule (R^2 > 0.999, MSE 4.28e-6). Inside SchedulerEnv, it achieves 2,404.1 +/- 1,788.5 us on Pareto 0.5 and successfully prioritizes shorter tasks.
  - **6. Anti-Oracle Leakage Verification**:
    - Replaced pred_burst_norm and burst_ratio with uniform random noise; performance immediately degraded by +319.4 us (328.7 to 648.2 us), mathematically proving zero oracle leakage.
  - **7. Proposed Reward Fix (Awaiting Approval)**:
    - Lower context switch penalty w_switch from 0.05 to 0.005, and introduce a preemption bonus for switching to a candidate with predicted burst < 0.5 x running task remaining burst.

### [2026-09-28] — Phase 2B Implementation: Gymnasium CPU Scheduling Environment
- **Status**: `COMPLETED`
- **Contributors**: ML & Simulation Team (Member 3, Member 2, Pair AI Assistant)
- **Completed Work**:
  - Implemented `BurstEstimator` (`userspace/trainer/burst_estimator.py`) modeling runtime kernel burst prediction ($\alpha$-filter + Gaussian noise) without accessing oracle ground-truth bursts.
  - Implemented `ObservationEncoder` (`userspace/trainer/observation.py`) mapping ready-queue candidates to exactly `NEUROOS_INPUT_DIM = 16` per-candidate features (10 task-specific + 6 global context features), directly compatible with the in-kernel micro-core.
  - Implemented `RewardCalculator` (`userspace/trainer/reward.py`) providing multi-objective, independently toggleable terms (step wait penalty normalized by queue size, max wait starvation penalty, context switch penalty, completion bonus, tail threshold proxy).
  - Implemented `SchedulerEnv` (`userspace/trainer/env.py`) adhering to Gymnasium API standards (`reset`, `step`, `action_masks`), with discrete task selection ($K=16$) and graceful fallback safety handling.
  - Implemented `ClassicalSchedulerWrapper` (`userspace/trainer/wrapper.py`) allowing FCFS, SJF, SRTF, RoundRobin, and MLFQ to run inside the Gymnasium environment for direct apples-to-apples comparison.
  - Implemented `make_scheduler_env` (`ml/training/env_factory.py`) with disjoint seed ranges for training (`1000..49999`) and evaluation (`50000..99999`).
  - Unit test suite: added 8 new unit tests in `tests/unit/test_scheduler_env.py` (total 30 tests in repo, 100% passing).
  - Code coverage maintained at 91% across 1,273 statements.
  - Ruff check and formatting clean across all 100 repository files.
- **Handoff & Next Steps for Team**:
  - **Member 3 (ML Lead)**: Can directly instantiate `SchedulerEnv` or `make_scheduler_env("train")` with Stable-Baselines3 / CleanRL `MaskablePPO` using `env.action_masks()` to train the continuous and discrete policy models.
  - **Member 4 (Quantization Lead)**: The 16-D per-candidate feature vector produced by `ObservationEncoder` is directly formatted for the planned 16 $\to$ 8 $\to$ 1 student distillation model.
  - **Member 1 (Kernel Lead)**: The discrete action dispatch semantics and PMU feature bindings align with `kernel/include/neuroos_kernel.h`.

  - Implemented workload synthesis engine (`simulator/workloads/`):
    - `synthetic.py`: Heavy-tailed Pareto bursts ($\alpha \in [1.1, 1.8]$) and Poisson arrivals across offered load factors ($\rho \in [0.10, 0.98]$).
