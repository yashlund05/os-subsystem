## Chronological Work Log

### [2026-09-22] — Phase 1 Implementation: Foundations & Classical Baselines
- **Status**: `COMPLETED`
- **Contributors**: Simulation & Systems Team (Member 2, Member 1, Pair AI Assistant)
- **Completed Work**:
  - Initialized `WORK_LOG.md` for team coordination across all 4 project members.
  - Implemented unified `BaseScheduler` abstraction and 5 classical CPU schedulers:
    - `schedulers/fcfs/scheduler.py`: $O(1)$ non-preemptive FIFO queue.
    - `schedulers/sjf/scheduler.py`: $O(\log n)$ non-preemptive min-heap sorted by total burst.
    - `schedulers/srtf/scheduler.py`: $O(\log n)$ preemptive min-heap with dynamic arrival preemption checks.
    - `schedulers/round_robin/scheduler.py`: $O(1)$ circular queue with parametric quantum ($q \in [1\text{ ms}, 50\text{ ms}]$).
    - `schedulers/mlfq/scheduler.py`: $K$-tier feedback queues with geometric quantum scaling ($q_k = q_0 \cdot 2^k$), demotion on quantum expiry, and periodic global starvation boost.
  - Implemented unified `BaseAllocator` abstraction and 4 dynamic memory allocators:
    - `allocators/fixed_partition/allocator.py`: MFT static partition table with internal fragmentation tracking.
    - `allocators/first_fit/allocator.py`: Dynamic variable partition linear scan with block splitting and coalescing.
    - `allocators/best_fit/allocator.py`: Dynamic variable partition smallest-viable-block search with external fragmentation sliver tracking.
    - `allocators/buddy/allocator.py`: Binary Buddy system with power-of-two recursive splitting and XOR buddy coalescing.
  - Implemented cycle-accurate discrete-event simulation engine (`simulator/scheduling/engine.py`) with context-switch penalties ($\bar{t}_{\text{ctx\_save}}$) and metric recording (TAT, NTAT, WT, RT, $P_{95}, P_{99}, P_{99.9}$, overhead ratio $\Phi_{overhead}$).
  - Implemented workload synthesis engine (`simulator/workloads/`):
    - `synthetic.py`: Heavy-tailed Pareto bursts ($\alpha \in [1.1, 1.8]$) and Poisson arrivals across offered load factors ($\rho \in [0.10, 0.98]$).
    - `trace_parser.py`: Google Borg cluster trace parser and SPEC CPU2017 replay model.
    - `adversarial.py`: Pathological convoy triggers and odd-even memory fragmentation churn triggers.
  - Implemented automated benchmark harness (`benchmarks/runner.py`) outputting structured JSON conforming to `docs/Schema.md`.
  - Built comprehensive unit test suite in `tests/unit/`:
    - 22/22 tests passing with 90% overall code coverage.
    - Zero lint errors with `ruff`.
- **Handoff & Next Steps for Team**:
  - **Member 1 (Kernel Lead)**: Reference `kernel/include/` and `schedulers/base.py` to prepare the pure C SPSC ring buffer implementation and sched_ext stub.
  - **Member 2 (Simulation Lead)**: Expand benchmark sweep scripts in `scripts/benchmark/` to generate baseline comparison matrices across load factors $\rho \in [0.10, 0.98]$.
  - **Member 3 (ML Lead)**: Begin Phase 2 (Week 3) offline DRL training pipeline (`userspace/trainer/`) using the simulated gym-like environment hooked into `simulator/scheduling/engine.py`.
  - **Member 4 (Quantization Lead)**: Review `ml/models/policy_interface.py` to prepare the 16 $\to$ 8 $\to$ 1 integer quantization pipeline and lookup table (LUT) builders.
